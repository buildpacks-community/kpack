## Contributor Ladder

Hello! We are excited that you want to learn more about our project contributor ladder! This contributor ladder outlines the different contributor roles within the project, along with the responsibilities and privileges that come with them. Community members generally start at the first levels of the "ladder" and advance up it as their involvement in the project grows.  Our project members are happy to help you advance along the contributor ladder.

Each of the contributor roles below is organized into lists of three types of things. "Responsibilities" are things that a contributor is expected to do. "Requirements" are qualifications a person needs to meet to be in that role, and "Privileges" are things contributors on that level are entitled to.


### Community Participant
<!--This role spells out what's expected of general community participants.  This is the lowest
level of participation in the project, and as such many projects don't bother to
define it and leave this section out.-->
<!--TODO: project leads to fill in exact details of this role for your project-->
Description: A Community Participant engages with the project and its community, contributing their time, thoughts, etc. Community participants are usually users who have stopped being anonymous and started being active in project discussions.

* Responsibilities:
    * Must follow the [CNCF CoC](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/main/code-of-conduct.md)
* How users can get involved with the community:
    * Participating in community discussions
    * Helping other users
    * Submitting bug reports
    * Commenting on issues
    * Trying out new releases
    * Attending community events
    * [TODO: Other examples of non-contribution participation]


### Contributor
<!-- This role describes people who have just started contributing, or who contribute occasionally but don't participate in project governance or have defined responsibilities.  Usually projects define either this level or Community Participant, but not both.  If you don't define this role, make sure to copy over its requirements to Organization Member -->
<!--TODO: project leads to fill in exact details of this role for your project-->
Description: A Contributor contributes directly to the project and adds value to it. Contributions need not be code. People at the Contributor level may be new contributors, or they may only contribute occasionally.

* Responsibilities include:
    * Follow the CNCF CoC
    * Follow the project contributing guide
* Requirements (one or several of the below):
    * Report and sometimes resolve issues
    * Occasionally submit PRs
    * Contribute to the documentation
    * Show up at meetings, takes notes
    * Answer questions from other community members
    * Submit feedback on issues and PRs
    * Test releases and patches and submit reviews
    * Run or helps run events
    * Promote the project in public
    * Help run the project infrastructure
    * [TODO: other small contributions]
* Privileges:
    * Invitations to contributor events
    * Eligible to become an Organization Member


### Organization Member
<!--This role is used by many projects where you have to be a regular contributor to have the right to vote in project elections, or to be able to operate project
CI/CD automation.  If these rights do not apply to you, then it makes sense to combine this role with the Contributor role.  For most projects, Org Member is the \
lowest level with clearly defined responsibilities and rights, because it is tied to permissions on the project's code repository. -->
<!--TODO: project leads to fill in exact details of this role for your project-->
Description: An Organization Member is an established contributor who regularly participates in the project. Organization Members have privileges in both project repositories and elections, and as such are expected to act in the interests of the whole project.

An Organization Member must meet the responsibilities and has the requirements of a Contributor, plus:

* Responsibilities include:
    * Continues to contribute regularly, as demonstrated by having at least [TODO: Number] [TODO: Metric] a year, as demonstrated by [TODO: contributor metrics source]. <!-- Example: "as demonstrated by having at least 50 GitHub contributions per year, as shown by Devstats"-->
* Requirements:
    * Must have successful contributions to the project, including at least one of the following:
        * [TODO: Number] accepted PRs,
        * Reviewed [TODO: Number] PRs,
        * Resolved and closed [TODO: Number] Issues,
        * Become responsible for a key project management area,
        * Or some equivalent combination or contribution
    * Must have been contributing for at least [TODO: Number] months
    * Must be actively contributing to at least one project area
    * Must have two sponsors who are also Organization Members, at least one of whom does not work for the same employer
    * [TODO: other requirements] <!--TODO: such as repository access or enabling 2FA on their GitHub account -->

* Privileges:
    * May be assigned Issues and Reviews
    * May give commands to CI/CD automation
    * Entitled to vote in the [TODO: appropriate election]
    * Can be added to [TODO: Repo Host] teams
    * Can recommend other contributors to become Org Members
    * [TODO: Other Privileges]


The process for a Contributor to become an Organization Member is as follows:

### Maintainer
Description: Maintainers are very established contributors who are responsible for the entire project. As such, they have the ability to approve PRs against any area of the project, and are expected to participate in making decisions about the strategy and priorities of the project.

#### Becoming a Maintainer

To become a Maintainer you need to demonstrate the following:

* commitment to the project:
  * participate in discussions (e.g., working group), contributions, code and documentation reviews
    for **1 year** or more,
  * perform reviews for **10** non-trivial pull requests,
  * contribute **5** non-trivial pull requests and have them merged,
* ability to write quality code and/or documentation,
* ability to collaborate with the team,
* understanding of how the team works (policies, processes for testing and code review, etc),
* understanding of the project's code base and coding and documentation style.
  <!-- add any additional Maintainer requirements here -->

A new Maintainer must be proposed by an existing maintainer during kpack working group meetings. A simple majority vote of existing Maintainers
approves the application.  Maintainers nominations will be evaluated without prejudice
to employer or demographics.

Maintainers who are selected will be granted the necessary GitHub rights.

#### Removing a Maintainer

Maintainers may resign at any time if they feel that they will not be able to
continue fulfilling their project duties.

Maintainers may also be removed after being inactive, failure to fulfill their
Maintainer responsibilities, violating the Code of Conduct, or other reasons.
Inactivity is defined as a period of very low or no activity in the project
for a year or more, with no definite schedule to return to full Maintainer
activity.

A Maintainer may be removed at any time by a 2/3 vote of the remaining maintainers.

Depending on the reason for removal, a Maintainer may be converted to Emeritus
status.  Emeritus Maintainers will still be consulted on some project matters,
and can be rapidly returned to Maintainer status if their availability changes.

Process of becoming a maintainer:
<!-- TODO: this process will vary widely across projects, both because of project code structure, and because of project governance.  For example, in some projects the Steering Committee approves new Maintainers.  What's below is just an example from a simple project in which the maintainers are also the project leaders, and which uses GitHub OWNERS files. 
1. Any current Maintainer may nominate a current Reviewer to become a new Maintainer, by opening a PR against the root of the [TODO: main repository name] adding the nominee as an Approver in the OWNERS file.
2. The nominee will add a comment to the PR testifying that they agree to all requirements of becoming a Maintainer.
3. A majority of the current Maintainers must then approve the PR. -->

## Inactivity
<!--TODO: project leads to fill in exact details for how you measure inactivity for your project-->
It is important for contributors to be and stay active to set an example and show commitment to the project. Inactivity is harmful to the project as it may lead to unexpected delays, contributor attrition, and a lost of trust in the project.

* Inactivity is measured by:
    * Periods of no contributions for longer than [TODO: Number] months
    * Periods of no communication for longer than [TODO: Number] months
* Consequences of being inactive include:
    * Involuntary removal or demotion
    * Being asked to move to Emeritus status

## Involuntary Removal or Demotion

Involuntary removal/demotion of a contributor happens when responsibilities and requirements aren't being met. This may include repeated patterns of inactivity, extended period of inactivity, a period of failing to meet the requirements of your role, and/or a violation of the Code of Conduct. This process is important because it protects the community and its deliverables while also opens up opportunities for new contributors to step in.

Involuntary removal or demotion is handled through a vote by a majority of the current Maintainers.

## Stepping Down/Emeritus Process
If and when contributors' commitment levels change, contributors can consider stepping down (moving down the contributor ladder) vs moving to emeritus status (completely stepping away from the project).

Contact the Maintainers about changing to Emeritus status, or reducing your contributor level.
