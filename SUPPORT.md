# Support Policy

## Security Vulnerabilities
If you believe that you've found a security vulnerability, please check [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) to learn how to disclose responsibly.

## GitHub Issues
We choose not to use GitHub issues for general usage questions and support, preferring to use issues solely for the tracking of bugs and enhancements.  If you have a general usage question please do not open a GitHub issue, but use one of the other channels described below.

If you are reporting a bug, please help to speed up problem diagnosis by providing as much information as possible.  Ideally, that would include a small sample project that reproduces the problem..

## Slack
The kpack community monitors [CNCF slack](https://cloud-native.slack.com/channels/buildpacks-kpack).  Before asking a question please search the history to see if the question has already been asked and answered.
