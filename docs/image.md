# Image Resources

Image resources provide a configuration for kpack to build and maintain a docker image utilizing [Cloud Native Buildpacks](http://buildpacks.io).
kpack will monitor the inputs to the image resource to rebuild the OCI image when the underlying source or the builder's buildpacks or stacks have changed.

Corresponding `kp` cli command docs [here](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/kpack-cli/blob/main/docs/kp_image.md).

The following defines the relevant fields of the `image` resource spec in more detail:

- `tag`: The image tag.
- `additionalTags`: Any additional list of image tags that should be published. This list of tags is mutable.
- `builder`: Configuration of the `builder` resource the image builds will use. See more info [Builder Configuration](builders.md).
- `serviceAccountName`: The Service Account name that will be used for credential lookup.
- `source`: The source code that will be monitored/built into images. See the [Source Configuration](#source-config) section below.
- `cache`: Caching configuration, two variants are available:
  - `volume.size`: Creates a Volume Claim of the given size
  - `volume.storageClassName`: (Optional) Creates a Volume Claim of the given storageClassName. If unset, the default storage class is used. The field is immutable.
  - `registry.tag`: Creates an image with cached contents
- `failedBuildHistoryLimit`: The maximum number of failed builds for an image that will be retained.
- `successBuildHistoryLimit`: The maximum number of successful builds for an image that will be retained.
- `imageTaggingStrategy`: Allow for builds to be additionally tagged with the build number. Valid options are `None` and `BuildNumber`.
- `build`: Configuration that is passed to every image build. See [Build Configuration](#build-config) section below.
- `defaultProcess`: The [default process type](https://buildpacks.io/docs/app-developer-guide/run-an-app/) for the built OCI image
- `projectDescriptorPath`: Path to the [project descriptor file](https://buildpacks.io/docs/reference/config/project-descriptor/) relative to source root dir or `subPath` if set. If unset, kpack will look for `project.toml` at the root dir or `subPath` if set.
- `cosign`: Configuration for additional cosign image signing. See [Cosign Configuration](#cosign-config) section below.

### <a id='tags-config'></a> Configuring Tags

The `tag` field is the location the built OCI image will be written to for each build. This field is immutable.

Examples:

- `tag: dockerhubuser/repo`
- `tag: dockerhubuser/repo:my-image`
- `tag: gcr.io/project/repo`

The `additionalTags` is a list of locations the built OCI image will be written to in addition to the `tag`. Additional tags must be in the same registry as the `tag`. Cross registry exporting is not supported. This field can be modified.

Example:

```yaml
tag: my-registry.io/project/repo 
additionalTags:
- my-registry.io/project/repo:some-version
- my-registry.io/project/repo:some-metadata
- my-registry.io/project/other-repo
```

### <a id='builder-config'></a>Builder Configuration

The `builder` field describes the [builder resource](builders.md) that will build the OCI images for a provided image configuration. It can be defined in exactly one of the following ways:

* Cluster Builder

    ```yaml
    builder:
        name: cluster-builder-name
        kind: ClusterBuilder
    ```
    - `name`: The name of the ClusterBuilder resource in kubernetes.
    - `kind`: The type as defined in kubernetes. This will always be ClusterBuilder.

* Namespaced Builder

    ```yaml
    builder:
        name: builder-name
        kind: Builder
    ```
    - `name`: The name of the Builder resource in kubernetes.
    - `kind`: The type as defined in kubernetes. This will always be Builder.

> Note: This image resource can only reference builders defined in the same namespace. This is not true for ClusterBuilders because they are not namespace scoped.

### <a id='source-config'></a>Source Configuration

The `source` field is a composition of a source code location and a `subpath`. It can be configured in exactly one of the following ways:

* Git

    ```yaml
    source:
      git:
        url: ""
        revision: ""
      subPath: ""
    ```
    - `git`: (Source Code is a git repository)
        - `url`: The git repository url. Both https and ssh formats are supported; with ssh format requiring a [ssh secret](secrets.md#git-secrets).
        - `revision`: The git revision to use. This value may be a commit sha, branch name, or tag.
    - `subPath`: A subdirectory within the source folder where application code resides. Can be ignored if the source code resides at the `root` level.

* Blob

    ```yaml
    source:
      blob:
        url: ""
        stripComponents: 0
      subPath: ""
    ```
    - `blob`: (Source Code is a blob/jar in a blobstore)
        - `url`: The URL of the source code blob. This blob needs to either be publicly accessible or have the access token in the URL
        - `stripComponents`: Optional number of directory components to strip from the blobs content when extracting.
    - `subPath`: A subdirectory within the source folder where application code resides. Can be ignored if the source code resides at the `root` level.

* Registry

    ```yaml
    source:
      registry:
        image: ""
        imagePullSecrets:
        - name: ""
      subPath: ""
    ```
    - `registry` ( Source code is an OCI image in a registry that contains application source)
        - `image`: Location of the source image
        - `imagePullSecrets`: A list of `dockercfg` or `dockerconfigjson` secret names required if the source image is private
    - `subPath`: A subdirectory within the source folder where application code resides. Can be ignored if the source code resides at the `root` level.

### <a id='build-config'></a>Build Configuration

The `build` field on the `image` resource can be used to configure env variables required during the build process, to configure resource limits on `CPU` and `memory`, and to configure pod tolerations, node selector, build timout (specified in seconds), and affinity.

```yaml
build:
  env:
    - name: "name of env variable"
      value: "value of the env variable"
  resources:
      requests:
        cpu: "0.25"
        memory: "128M"
      limits:
        cpu: "0.5"
        memory: "256M"
  tolerations:
    - key: "key1"
      operator: "Exists"
      effect: "NoSchedule"
  nodeSelector:
    disktype: ssd
  buildTimeout: 1600
  affinity:
    nodeAffinity:
      requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
        nodeSelectorTerms:
          - matchExpressions:
              - key: kubernetes.io/e2e-az-name
                operator: In
                values:
                  - e2e-az1
                  - e2e-az2
```

See the kubernetes documentation on [setting environment variables](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/define-environment-variable-container/) and [resource limits and requests](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-compute-resources-container/#resource-requests-and-limits-of-pod-and-container) for more information.

### <a id='cosign-config'></a>Cosign Configuration

#### Cosign Signing Secret
OCI images built by kpack can be signed with cosign when a cosign formatted secret is added to the service account configured on the image resource.
The secret can be added using the cosign CLI or manually. 

To create a cosign signing secret through the cosign CLI, when targetted to the Kubernetes cluster, use:
`cosign generate-key-pair k8s://[NAMESPACE]/[NAME]`

Alternatively, create the cosign secret and provide your own cosign key files manually to Kubernetes by running the following command:
```shell script
% kubectl create secret generic <secret-name> --from-literal=cosign.password=<password> --from-file=</path/to/cosign.key>
```
- `<secret-name>`: The name of the secret. Ensure that the secret is created in the same namespace as the eventual image resource.
- `<password>`: The password provided to encrypt the private key. If not present, an empty password will be used.
- `</path/to/cosign.key>`: The cosign private key file generated with `cosign generate-key-pair`.

After adding the cosign secret, the secret must be added to the list of `secrets` on the service account that the image is configured with.

#### Adding Cosign Annotations
By default, the build number and build timestamp information will be added to the cosign signing annotations. Users can specify additional cosign annotations under the spec key.
```yaml
cosign:
  annotations:
  - name: "annotationName"
    value: "annotationValue"
```

One way these annotations can be viewed is through verifying cosign signatures. The annotations will be under the `optional` key in the verified JSON response. For example, this can be done with:
```bash
% cosign verify -key /path/to/cosign.pub registry.example.com/project/image@sha256:<DIGEST>
```

Which provides a JSON response similar to:
```json
{
  "critical": {
    "identity": {
      "docker-reference": "registry.example.com/project/image"
    }, "image": {
      "docker-manifest-digest": "sha256:<DIGEST>"
    }, "type": "cosign container image signature"
  }, "optional": {
    "buildNumber": "1",
    "buildTimestamp": "20210827.175240",
    "annotationName": "annotationValue"
  }
}
```

#### Push Cosign Signature to a Different Location
Cosign signatures can be pushed to a different registry from where the built OCI image is written to. To enable this, add the corresponding annotation to the cosign secret resource.
```
metadata:
  name: ...
  namespace: ...
  annotations:
    kpack.io/cosign.repository: other.registry.com/project/image
data:
  cosign.key: ...
  cosign.password: ...
```
This will be equivalent to setting `COSIGN_REPOSITORY` as specified in cosign [Specifying Registry](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign#specifying-registry)

The service account configured on the image resource must have registry credentials for the other registry configured in the `secrets` list (they do not need to be configured as `imagePullSecrets`).

It should be noted that if you wish to push the signatures to the same registry but a different repository as the image resource `tag`, the credential used must have access to both paths. You cannot use two separate credentials for the same registry.

#### Cosign Legacy Docker Media Types
To sign docker images in a registry that does not fully support OCI media types, legacy equivalents can be used by adding the corresponding annotation to the cosign secret resource:
```
metadata:
  name: ...
  namespace: ...
  annotations:
    kpack.io/cosign.docker-media-types: "1"
data:
  cosign.key: ...
  cosign.password: ...
```
This will be equivalent to setting `COSIGN_DOCKER_MEDIA_TYPES=1` as specified in the cosign [registry-support](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign#registry-support)

### Sample Image Resource with a Git Source

```yaml
apiVersion: kpack.io/v1alpha2
kind: Image
metadata:
  name: sample-image
  namespace: build-namespace
spec:
  tag: gcr.io/project-name/app
  serviceAccountName: service-account
  builder:
    name: sample-builder
    kind: ClusterBuilder
  cache:
    volume:
      size: "1.5Gi" # Optional, if not set then the caching feature is disabled
      storageClassName: "my-storage-class" # Optional, if not set then the default storageclass is used
  failedBuildHistoryLimit: 5 # Optional, if not present defaults to 10
  successBuildHistoryLimit: 5 # Optional, if not present defaults to 10
  source:
    git:
      url: https://github.com/buildpack/sample-java-app.git
      revision: main
  build: # Optional
    env:
      - name: BP_JAVA_VERSION
        value: 8.*
    resources:
      limits:
        cpu: 100m
        memory: 1G
      requests:
        cpu: 50m
        memory: 512M
```

Source for github can also be specified in the ssh format if there is a corresponding ssh secret

```yaml
  source:
    git:
      url: git@github.com/buildpack/sample-java-app.git
      revision: main
```

### Sample Image Resource with hosted zip or jar as a source

```yaml
apiVersion: kpack.io/v1alpha2
kind: Image
metadata:
  name: sample-image
  namespace: build-namespace
spec:
  tag: gcr.io/project-name/app
  serviceAccountName: service-account
  builder:
    name: sample-builder
    kind: ClusterBuilder
  cache:
    volume:
      size: "1.5Gi" # Optional, if not set then the caching feature is disabled
      storageClassName: "my-storage-class" # Optional, if not set then the default storageclass is used
  failedBuildHistoryLimit: 5 # Optional, if not present defaults to 10
  successBuildHistoryLimit: 5 # Optional, if not present defaults to 10
  source:
    blob:
      url: https://storage.googleapis.com/build-service/sample-apps/spring-petclinic-2.1.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT.jar
  build: # Optional
    env:
      - name: BP_JAVA_VERSION
        value: 8.*
    resources:
      limits:
        cpu: 100m
        memory: 1G
      requests:
        cpu: 50m
        memory: 512M
```

#### Status

When an image resource has successfully built with its current configuration, its status will report the up to date fully qualified built OCI image reference.

If you are using `kubectl` this information is available with `kubectl get <image-resource-name>` or `kubectl describe <image-resource-name>`.

```yaml
status:
  conditions:
  - lastTransitionTime: "2020-01-17T16:16:36Z"
    status: "True"
    type: Succeeded
  latestImage: index.docker.io/sample/image@sha256:d3eb15a6fd25cb79039594294419de2328f14b443fa0546fa9e16f5214d61686
  ...
``` 

When a build fails its status will report the condition Succeeded=False. 

```yaml
status:
  conditions:
  - lastTransitionTime: "2020-01-17T16:13:48Z"
    status: "False"
    type: Succeeded
  ...
```

### Legacy apiVersion kpack.io/v1alpha1

Notable deprecations from `kpack.io/v1alpha1` include:
- Notary image signing
- [Cloud Native Buildpack service bindings](docs/legacy-cnb-servicebindings.md)

`kpack.io/v1alpha1` will eventually be removed entirely so please migrate existing Image resources to use `kpack.io/v1alpha2` apis.

#### <a id='notary-config'></a>Notary Configuration

`apiVersion` must be `kpack.io/v1alpha1`

The optional `notary` field on the `image` resource can be used to configure [Notary](https://github.com/theupdateframework/notary) image signing.
```yaml
notary:
  v1:
    url: "https://example.com/notary"
    secretRef:
      name: "notary-secret"
```
- `v1.url`: The URL of the notary server.
- `v1.secretRef.name`: A [secret](#notary-secret) containing the encrypted private key and private key password.

#### Generate Signing Key
To generate a signing key, use the following commands from the [Docker Content Trust](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/trust/#signing-images-with-docker-content-trust) documentation:
```shell script
% export DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST_SERVER=<notary-server-url>
% docker trust key generate my-key
% docker trust signer add --key my-key.pub my-key registry.example.com/org/app
```
This will generate a private key in `~/.docker/trust/private` encrypted with the user provided password.

#### <a id='notary-secret'></a>Create Notary Secret
To create the notary secret used by kpack for image signing, run the following command:
```shell script
% kubectl create secret generic <secret-name> --from-literal=password=<password> --from-file=$HOME/.docker/trust/private/<hash>.key
```
- `<secret-name>`: The name of the secret. Ensure that the secret is created in the same namespace as the eventual image resource.
- `<password>`: The password provided to encrypt the private key.
- `<hash>.key`: The private key file.
