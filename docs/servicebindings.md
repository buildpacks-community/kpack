# Service Bindings

kpack Images can be configured with Service Bindings as described in the [Cloud Native Buildpacks Bindings specification](https://github.com/buildpacks/spec/blob/adbc70f5672e474e984b77921c708e1475e163c1/extensions/bindings.md).       

At build-time, service bindings are handled by the buildpacks being used for that Image. Check the desired buildpack documentation for details on the service bindings it supports. 

To configure an Image with a service binding, you must create the following:

* A Secret containing the service binding data
  * The Secret `stringData` field must contain key-value pairs of `<binding file name>:<binding data>`. For each key-value pair, a file will be created that is accessible during build.
* A ConfigMap containing the metadata for the service binding
  * The ConfigMap must have the fields `data.kind` and `data.provider` populated. The buildpacks used to build the image will handle the service bindings based on these fields.
* An Image referencing that Secret and ConfigMap in the `spec.build.bindings` field.

### Sample maven app Image with a settings.xml service binding: 

```yaml
apiVersion: kpack.io/v1alpha1
kind: Image
metadata:
  name: sample-binding-with-secret
spec:
  tag: my-registry.com/repo
  builder:
    kind: ClusterBuilder
    name: default
  source:
    git:
      url: https://github.com/buildpack/sample-java-app.git
      revision: 0eccc6c2f01d9f055087ebbf03526ed0623e014a
  build:
    bindings:
    - name: settings
      secretRef:
        name: settings-xml
   	  metadataRef:
   	    name: settings-binding-metadata
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: settings-xml
type: Opaque
stringData:
  settings.xml: <settings>...</settings>
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: settings-binding-metadata
data:
  kind: maven
  provider: sample
```

The above example will result in the following files being available during Builds of the Image matching the [directory layout](https://github.com/buildpacks/spec/blob/adbc70f5672e474e984b77921c708e1475e163c1/extensions/bindings.md#example-directory-structure) of the CNB spec:

```plain
<platform>
└── bindings
    └── settings
        ├── metadata
        │   ├── kind
        │   └── provider
        └── secret
            └── setting.xml
```
